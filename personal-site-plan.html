      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Imagine having all the most interesting astronomy articles, stunning space photos, and the latest discoveries in one convenient place. 
        My website is going to have just that. It will act as a guide for astronomy enthusiasts and include some interesting facts, current events, 
        and links to recent scientific papers and news articles about space. It will also include tips for stargazing and observing celestial objects. 
        This website will be the perfect starting point for anyone who is curious about this magnificent topic. </p>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This space website will be for all space and astronomy enthusiasts who are looking for a place where they can find interesting articles, links to studies, and fun facts, all on one website. The home page will be a hub for all things astronomy, including some of the latest data and pictures from NASA. One page will be filled with trivia and fun facts about space. The other page will focus more on the science. This way, there is something for everyone who visits this website, whether you are an amature astronomer who wants to keep up with current events, a scientist who wants access to all of the most recent papers and articles, or someone who just wants to learn a little more. 
	Why this website? There are many space website out there. They are all wonderful, but many of them are not very user friendly. Some of these websites are aimed for children who have a curiosity to learn more about space. Others are aimed more towards scientists and physics students. They have a big focus on the mathematics and complex aspects of astrophysics. This is great, and those websites are needed! However, they are not ideal for people who do not already have a decent knowledge of physics. Our website is the solution! We want everything to be found in one place so that everyone, regardless of experience level, has something to learn from this website.

      <h3>Trivia and Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>
        Do you have any questions about space? Look no further! You can browse through out trivia and fun facts section, updated periodically to include the most current data and events going on with NASA. For example: Did you know that Saturn's rings are about 175,000 miles (282,000 km) across, but only about 3,200 feet (~1 km) thick? That is so thin that when you are looking at them through a telescope while they are perfectly flat, you can’t see them at all; but when they are sideways, they are extremely refined and easy to see. Find more fun facts here on our website, and fill out the box below if you want to submit some of your own fun facts about space! 
	This page will also have some multiple choice trivia questions. Compete with your friends, and show off how much you know! For example: How many known moons does Jupiter have? 
A. 76
B. 81
C. 95
D. 101 
The answer is 95! Add your own trivia questions below.

      <h3>Science</h3>
      <p>
        This page will focus on some of the recent scientific findings, and latest missions from NASA and SpaceX. For example, one exciting current event is NASA’s Artemis missions! These will include 4 separate missions, one of which will yet again send humans to the moon. These will be the first humans to explore the lunar south pole region; an amazing feat as humans have not stepped foot on the moon in decades. The artemis missions also aim to establish a long-term presence on the moon, a feat previously thought impossible. Amazing things are underway in the world of Space!
	This page will also link to some interesting articles on the more complex topics, such as dark matter and dark energy. These topics will be explained in a way that your average person can understand what they are, and can then do further research if they wish. As these topics are very scientific in nature, our goal is to implement them iks a way that everyone can learn more about them and decide whether it interests them. Perhaps we can spark curiosity in people who will one day make amazing discoveries in these fields.
