        <p>This page will focus on some of the recent scientific findings, and latest missions 
            from NASA and SpaceX. For example, one exciting current event is NASA’s Artemis 
            missions! These will include 4 separate missions, one of which will yet again send 
            humans to the moon. These will be the first humans to explore the lunar south pole 
            region; an amazing feat as humans have not stepped foot on the moon in decades. 
            The artemis missions also aim to establish a long-term presence on the moon, a feat 
            previously thought impossible. Amazing things are underway in the world of Space! 
            This page will also link to some interesting articles on the more complex topics, 
            such as dark matter and dark energy. These topics will be explained in a way that 
            your average person can understand what they are, and can then do further research 
            if they wish. As these topics are very scientific in nature, our goal is to implement 
            them iks a way that everyone can learn more about them and decide whether it interests 
            them. Perhaps we can spark curiosity in people who will one day make amazing 
            discoveries in these fields.</p>
