            <p>This space website will be for all space and astronomy enthusiasts who are looking for a 
            place where they can find interesting articles, links to studies, and fun facts, all on one website. 
            The home page will be a hub for all things astronomy, including some of the latest data and pictures 
            from NASA. One page will be filled with trivia and fun facts about space. The other page will focus 
            more on the science. This way, there is something for everyone who visits this website, whether you 
            are an amature astronomer who wants to keep up with current events, a scientist who wants access to 
            all of the most recent papers and articles, or someone who just wants to learn a little more. Why this
            website? There are many space website out there. They are all wonderful, but many of them are not very 
            user friendly. Some of these websites are aimed for children who have a curiosity to learn more about 
            space. Others are aimed more towards scientists and physics students. They have a big focus on the 
            mathematics and complex aspects of astrophysics. This is great, and those websites are needed! 
            However, they are not ideal for people who do not already have a decent knowledge of physics. 
            Our website is the solution! We want everything to be found in one place so that everyone, 
            regardless of experience level, has something to learn from this website.</p>
